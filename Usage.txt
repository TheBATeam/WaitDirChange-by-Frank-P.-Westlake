Waits until a folder has changed and notifies which file was changed.

WaitDirChg [options] "Folder name"

[options (case not sensitive)]
 /F            Print the full file path (default is a relative path).
 /L            Loop until CTRL-C or CTRL-BREAK.
 /S            Also watch subdirectories.
 /T            Print a date and time stamp in the first two columns.
 /FILE_NAME    Watches for changes to file names (add, del, ren)(default).
 /DIR_NAME     Watches for changes to directory names (md, rd, ren).
 /ATTRIBUTES   Watches for changes to file attributes.
 /SIZE         Watches for changes to file size.
 /LAST_WRITE   Watches for changes to file last write time.
 /LAST_ACCESS  Watches for changes to file last access time.
 /CREATION     Watches for changes to file creation time.
 /SECURITY     Watches for changes to file security-descriptor.
 /ANY          Watches for any changes in the folder.

The program exits when the first change is detected and reports only that
change, unless the /L switch is included. If the /L switch is included the
program will return to watching the folder (some changes may be lost between
cycles).
